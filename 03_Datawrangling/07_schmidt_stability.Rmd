```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#calculating schmidt stability 

BVRbath <- bath|>
  filter(Reservoir == "BVR")|>
  select(Depth_m, SA_m2)
```
  
Prepare data frame
```{r}
weekly_temp_profiles <- temp_depths_cleaned |>
  mutate(
    Week = week(Date),
    Day = day(Date),
    Year = year(Date),
    RoundedDepth = round(Depth_m)  # Round to the nearest meter
  ) |>
  group_by(Date, RoundedDepth) |>
  slice_min(abs(Depth_m - RoundedDepth), with_ties = FALSE) |>  # Select depth closest to that rounded meter
  ungroup()|>
  left_join(water_level, by = c("Week", "Year"))|>
  select(-buoyancy_freq)
```

Need to make correction for different water levels and bathymetry.
Currently the Bath frame is 0-14. 
For each Date the max depth needs to be subtracted from 14. ex: BathDiff = 14 - max(Depth_m) [example: 2]
Then make a column called BathAdj = Roundeddepth + BathDiff
Then left join BVRbath to BathAdj

```{r}
new_bath <- weekly_temp_profiles|>
  group_by(Date)|>
  mutate(BathDiff = 14 - max(RoundedDepth), 
         BathAdj = RoundedDepth + BathDiff)|>
  ungroup()|>
  left_join(BVRbath, by = c("BathAdj" = "Depth_m"))|>
  select(-RoundedDepth, -WaterLevel_m, -BathDiff, -BathAdj, -buoyancy_freq)
```
Yay! Now we have different bathymetry for each Date
Let's try to calculate Schmidt stability
```{r}
schmidt_frame <- new_bath|>
  group_by(Date)|>
  mutate(schmidt_stability = schmidt.stability(Temp_C, Depth_m, SA_m2, Depth_m))|>
  ungroup()|>
  group_by(Year, Week)|>
  summarise(schmidt_stability = mean(schmidt_stability))|>
  ungroup()
```
```{r}
final_schmidt <- frame_weeks|>
  left_join(schmidt_frame, by = c("Week", "Year"))|>
  select(-WaterLevel_m)
```
